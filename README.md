Vector Auto Regression (VAR) comes with an advantage in easy implementation. Every equation in the VAR has the same number of variables on the right-hand side, the coefficients {α1, α2, …, β11, β21, …, γ 11, γ 21, … } of the overall system can be easily estimated by applying (OLS) regression to each equation individually. We could estimate this model using the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator computed separately from each equations. Since the OLS estimator has standard asymptotic properties, it is possible to test any linear restriction, either in one equation or across equations, with the standard t and F statistics. The VAR models have the advantage over traditional machine learning models in that the results are not hidden by a large and complicated structure (“black box”), but are easily interpreted and available.
